Working within the order of precedence of sources referenced within this document. It is best to start with the work of Kays and London \citetitle{london-book}, which is a landmark of the field and is still highly cited in modern research as its ubiquitous use in the design of simple heat exchangers \cite{london-book}; in addition, the referenced articles within the chapters of the book are in my opinion essential in the understanding of the dynamics of traditional two-stream heat exchangers \cite{hx-london-singleFluid, hx-london-twoFluid, hx-dusinberre-numericalMethods}.
